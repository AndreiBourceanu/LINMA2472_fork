# Large Language Models and Diffusion Models

To visualize the [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks, there are two options.

## Option 1 : Static version

Follow [this link](https://blegat.github.io/LINMA2472/) with your web browser.
To visualize it as slides, open the javascript console of your web browser and enter `present()`. To leave this slide mode, enter `present()` again.
To enter full screen mode, use `F11` on your keyboard.

## Option 2 : Dynamic version

First, download the `.jl` file in this repository (e.g., by [downloading a zip](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) or using [`git clone`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).

Now, install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) (I recommend doing this using [juliaup](https://julialang.org/downloads/#juliaup_-_julia_version_manager)).
Once this is completed, [install and then run Pluto](https://plutojl.org/#install).
